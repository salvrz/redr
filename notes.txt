Lemma 2.1: If every station S(i), (1 <_ i <_ p), knows the
values of the *global* and *local* prefix sums above, the routing
can be performed in n time slots with each S(i) being awake
for exactly si + di time slots.

Relative initialization for nodes with packets destined for node i.

1. relative_init()
2. compute_prefix_sums()
3. route()

interleaved_init()
l determines new partition numbers
l'_i-1..l'_i is the range of new partitions of the current partition Pj (not confused with Pi)
